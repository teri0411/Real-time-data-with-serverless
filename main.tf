 # Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-org-eca7ff"

#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "devops-01-final-TeamC-Scenario-02"
#         }
#       }
